## Global section
###############################################################################
##
## Start monit in the background (run as a daemon):
#
set daemon  30           # check services at 2-minute intervals
    with start delay 30  # optional: delay the first check by 4-minutes
#                           # (by default check immediately after monit start)
#
#
## Set syslog logging with the 'daemon' facility. If the FACILITY option is
## omitted, monit will use 'user' facility by default. If you want to log to
## a stand alone log file instead, specify the path to a log file
#
set logfile /var/log/monit.log
set idfile /var/lib/monit/id
set statefile /var/lib/monit/state

#
#
### Set the location of monit id file which saves the unique id specific for
### given monit. The id is generated and stored on first monit start.
### By default the file is placed in $HOME/.monit.id.
#
# set idfile /var/.monit.id
#
### Set the location of monit state file which saves the monitoring state
### on each cycle. By default the file is placed in $HOME/.monit.state. If
### state file is stored on persistent filesystem, monit will recover the
### monitoring state across reboots. If it is on temporary filesystem, the
### state will be lost on reboot.
#
# set statefile /var/.monit.state
#
## Set the list of mail servers for alert delivery. Multiple servers may be
## specified using comma separator. By default monit uses port 25 - this
## is possible to override with the PORT option.
#
#set mailserver SMTP.MAILHOSTER.COM port 587         # primary mailserver
#     username "LoginUsername" password "LoginPassword"
#     using tlsv12
#     with timeout 30 seconds
#
# set mailserver email-smtp.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com port 587
#    username "AKIAIVKHCRRONY2DNIPQ" password "Ar6iqnv4fU/5Sq7iJpAMj7sDHNPZAQH7Zmi/A1eRwZ+b"
#    using ssl

set mailserver smtp.gmail.com port 587
    username "monitagent@gmail.com"
    password "Monit.Agent.!@"
    using tlsv1 with timeout 30 seconds
#
## By default monit will drop alert events if no mail servers are available.
## If you want to keep the alerts for a later delivery retry, you can use the
## EVENTQUEUE statement. The base directory where undelivered alerts will be
## stored is specified by the BASEDIR option. You can limit the maximal queue
## size using the SLOTS option (if omitted, the queue is limited by space
## available in the back end filesystem).
#
# set eventqueue
#     basedir /var/monit  # set the base directory where events will be stored
#     slots 100           # optionaly limit the queue size
#
#

set eventqueue
      basedir /var/lib/monit/events # set the base directory where events will be stored
      slots 100                     # optionally limit the queue size
## Send status and events to M/Monit (Monit central management: for more
## informations about M/Monit see http://www.tildeslash.com/mmonit).
#
# set mmonit http://monit:monit@192.168.1.10:8080/collector
set ssl {
    verify: disable
    selfsigned: allow
}

#
#
## Monit by default uses the following alert mail format:
##
## --8<--
## From: monit@$HOST                         # sender
## Subject: monit alert --  $EVENT $SERVICE  # subject
##
## $EVENT Service $SERVICE                   #
##                                           #
## 	Date:        $DATE                   #
## 	Action:      $ACTION                 #
## 	Host:        $HOST                   # body
## 	Description: $DESCRIPTION            #
##                                           #
## Your faithful employee,                   #
## monit                                     #
## --8<--
##
## You can override this message format or parts of it, such as subject
## or sender using the MAIL-FORMAT statement. Macros such as $DATE, etc.
## are expanded at runtime. For example, to override the sender:

set mail-format {
from: monitagent@gmail.com
subject: $HOST -- $SERVICE $EVENT
message: $EVENT Service $SERVICE
Date:        $DATE
Action:      $ACTION
Host:        $HOST
Description: $DESCRIPTION
}

#
## You can set alert recipients here whom will receive alerts if/when a
## service defined in this file has errors. Alerts may be restricted on
## events by using a filter as in the second example below.
#

#set alert accelyaankit@gmail.com { nonexist, timeout, resource, icmp, connection } with reminder on 10 cycle
#set alert accelyaankit@gmail.com on { checksum, permission, uid, gid } with reminder on 10 cycle
#set alert accelyaankit@gmail.com with reminder on 10 cycle
set alert accelyaankit@gmail.com but not on { action, instance }


# set alert manager@foo.bar only on { timeout }  # receive just service-
#                                                # timeout alert
#
#
## Monit has an embedded web server which can be used to view status of
## services monitored, the current configuration, actual services parameters
## and manage services from a web interface.
#
#     allow @monit           # allow users of group 'monit' to connect (rw)
#     allow @users readonly  # allow users of group 'users' to connect readonly
#
#
set httpd port 2812 and
   use address {{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}  # only accept connection from localhost
   allow 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0                           # allow localhost to connect to the server and
   allow monituser:moniDd_t1_3ASDasd               # require user 'admin' with password 'monit'
